# Manyware

A lightweight middleware base designed to be used in anything requiring a middleware pattern.

### Not once has someone asked these, so I can't call it a FAQ:

* Isn't this a micro-dependency?
  * Yes, but I don't like copy/pasting tested code all over the place.
  * The pattern is stable and has absolutely zero reason to change, so it seems accepable to me.
  * I thought it would be fun to implement with generics; use it, or don't, I won't be offended.
* What's with the name?
  * Middleware for anything, "manyware". 
  * It could just as easily be called something akin to "workflows" but :shrug:
